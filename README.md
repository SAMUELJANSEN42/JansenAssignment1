# Recently framebuffers use floating point and thus support HDR colors more easily

# For computer graphics appli- cations, the most important use of custom VLSI circuits has been in creating pipeline architectures.

# The importance of the pipeline architecture has remained regardless of this cycle.

# Although some approaches such as ray tracing can come close to real time, none can achieve the performance of pipeline architectures with simple application programs and simple GPU programs.
